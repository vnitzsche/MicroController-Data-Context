This project is meant to provide a template for microcontrollers to create an easy-to-use visualization. You create a configurationfile for each microcontroller or multiple controllers. This file contains basic informations about the connection (f.e. USB or WiFi). The main part in the file is the declaration of pins. You declare a pin with its type (Digital, Analog, ...) and the code for the microcontroller as well as the interface for the visualization gets generated dynamically. You can then manipulate the data and I/Os of the microcontroller from the visualization at runtime.
